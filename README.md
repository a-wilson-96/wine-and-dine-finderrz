# Wine and Dine Finderrz 

## Description

We wanted to be able to create a simple application that can be used as a fun way to quickly come up with ideas for meal and cocktail pairings based of the the user's types of cuisine and alcohol they prefer. There was a lot of team effort to make this work and it was great learning further about local storage and API's.


## User Story

```
AS A host 
I WANT to see a pairing of a cocktail and a meal based on my likes
SO THAT I can review my saved my pairing for dinner ideas
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a cocktail and dinner matcher with form inputs
WHEN I search for a type of cuisine and a choice of alcohol
THEN I am presented with a pairing of a cocktail and dinner idea
WHEN I view the dinner and cocktail ideas 
THEN I am presented with the name of a cuisine and the name of cocktail 
WHEN I save the pairing 
THEN I have the option to view at a later time for future ideas 
WHEN I have seen my previous pairings of a dinner and cocktail
THEN I am able to generate a new pairing to be able to have different alternatives
```

## Usage

1. Choose your favorite type of cuisine and alcohol
2. Input them into proper input fields
3. Click "Submit"
4. If you want to save the pairing, click "Save Your Pairing"
5. To review saved pairings, click "Saved Pairings" on the navigation bar and it will direct you to a list of previous pairings
